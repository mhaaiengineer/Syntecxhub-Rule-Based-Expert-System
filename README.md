## Simple Forward-Chaining Rule Engine

An implementation of a classic **Expert System** using **Forward Chaining** logic.  
This engine accepts a base of facts (symptoms) and infers conclusions based on a predefined ruleset.

## How it Works

The engine uses **Forward Chaining**, which starts with known data and moves forward through the rules to see what else can be proven.

## How to Run

4. Type 'run' to start inference.
